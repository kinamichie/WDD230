            <li>CSS3 transform property lets yo translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page</li>
            <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up or down</li>
            <li>use translatex or translatey functions coma move an element vertically or horizontally</li>
            <li>The scale(x,y) functionscales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);</li>
            <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value</li>
            <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes</li>
            <li>You can control the origin from which your tansfors are applied</li>
            <li>The order of transform function matter</li>
            <li>CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration</li>
                <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state</li>
                <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The transition-property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default</li>
            <li>Its important to include a pre-state and a post-state</li>
            <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state</li>
            <li>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. most common timing function are ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out</li>
            <li>The transition-delay property makes it possble to introduce a delay before the transition begins</li>
            <li>Functions can be combined into a shorthand declaration</li>
            <li>Multiple transitions can happen in one call</li>
            <li>A e is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition</li>
            <li>Keyframes can be specified in any order</li>
            <li>Animation properties need two declarations for each property</li>
            <li>animation-name is used to attach an animation to an element</li>
            <li>animation-duration property defines the length of time an animation takes to complete one iteration</li>
            <li>animation-timing-function determmines how the animation will progress over its duration</li>
            <li>The animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through</li>
            <li>animation-direction property can change the default value for animation iterates</li>
            <li>animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation</li>
            <li>animation-fill-mode definew what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes</li>
            <li>animation-play-state property defines whether the animation is running or paused</li>
            <li>There is a shorthand property for all the animation properties</li>
        </ul>
