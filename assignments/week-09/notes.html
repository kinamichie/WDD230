            <li>A plus sign after something in a regular expression indicates that the element may be repeated more than once</li>
            <li>A * sign has a similar meaning but also allows the pattern to match zero times</li>
            <li>A question mark makes a part of a pattern otional, meaning it may occur zero times or one time</li>
            <li>T indicate that a pattern should occur a precise number of times, used braces {} after an element</li>
            <li>You can group sub-expressions but parenthesis must be used inbewteen</li>
            <li>The exec method will return null if no match was found and return an object with information about the match otherwise</li>
            <li>new Date() can be used to create and object for a specific time or date</li>

            <li>Document trees are another way to visualize how a page is layed out</li>
            <li>Because childNodes are not a real array, we cannto loop over it with for/of and have to run over the index range using a regular for loop or use Array.from</li>
            <li>Almost everything about the DOM structure can be changed</li>
            <li>Use replaceChild method to replace a child node with another one</li>
