        <ul><h2>Chapter 9</h2>
            <li>BOM = Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
            <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object</li>
            <li>window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box</li>
            <li>window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel</li>
            <li>sindow.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program and mshow a message, have an input field and allow a user to enter text</li>
            <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object which contains information about the browser being used</li>
            <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. The href property returns the full URL as a string</li>
            <li>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used</li>
            <li>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and port number</li>
            <li>The hostname property reutrns a string describing the domain of the current URL</li>
            <li>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</li>
            <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter</li>
            <li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method except the current page will not be stored in teh session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button</li>
            <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL</li>
            <li>The window.history can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session</li>
            <li>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page</li>
            <li>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</li>
            <li>The window.open() method can open a new window and the close() method can close it</li>
            <li>The window.moveTo() method can move the window using X and Y coordinates</li>
            <li>The window.scree object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on</li>
            <li>The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen</li>
            <li>The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the user's monitor</li>
            <li>Each window object contains a document object</li>
            <li>The document.write() method is frowned upon using</li>
            <li>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of names/value pairs separated by semicolons</li>
            <li>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript's 'cookie jar' using the document.cookie property</li>
            <li>You can change cookie values just by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value</li>
            <li>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie:</li>
            <li>const cookies = document.cookie.split("; "); 
                for (crumb of cookies){ 
                    const [key,value] = crumb.split("="); 
                    console.log(`The value of ${key} is ${value}`); 
                }
                << The value of name is Batman 
                The value of hero is true 
                The value of city is Gotham</li>
            <li>You can put an expiration date on a cookie by adding " expires=date"</li>
            <li>By default cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set</li>
            <li>Adding the string '; secure' to the end of a cookie will ensure it's only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network</li>
            <li>To delete a cookie just set it to expire at a time in the past</li>
            <li>window.setTimeout() methoed accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter</li>
            <li>The window.setInterval() method will repeatedly invoke the callvack function after every given number of milliseconds</li>
            <li>The setTimeout() method and the setInterval method can be used to animate elements on a web page</li>
            <li>.requestAnimationFrame results in a much smoother performance</li>
            <li>Animation is usually best to use in CSS</li>        
        </ul>
        <ul><h2>Chapter 14</h2>
            <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser</li>
            <li>localStorage can be used instead of cookies as a way of saving data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
                <li>newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed</li>
                <li>oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed</li>
                <li>storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage</li>
                <li>addEventListener('storage', (event) => { 
                    console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from
                    ${event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in 
                    ${event.storageArea}`) }, false);</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device but permission must be granted by the user</li>
            <li>The position object passed to the youAreHere() function has a coord property with a latitude and longitude property which together give the coordinates of the device</li>
            <ul>
                <li>position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second</li>
                <li>position.altitued property returns an estimate of the device's altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth</li>
                <li>position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from the North</li>
                <li>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript</li>
            <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server- also known as push messaging</li>
            <li>Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notification. You must have user permission</li>
            <li>Audio clips can be inserted into a page using the "audio" tag</li>
            <li>A video clip can be inserted using the "video" tag</li>
            <li>The play() method will start the clip playing from its current position</li>
            <li>The pause() mothod will pause the clip at its current position</li>
            <li>The volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume</li>
            <li>The muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio</li>
            <li>The currrentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to another part of the clip</li>
            <li>the playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by changing its value</li>
            <li>The loop property is a boolean value that can be set to true to make the clip repeat in a loop</li>
            <li>The duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts</li>
            <li>Audio and video clips also ahave a number of events that will fre when they occur including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The play event, which fres when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause</li>
                <li>The pause event, which fres when the clip is paused</li>
