        description: "Keen's Myotis is a medium-sized bat with dark silky brown fur and indistinct dark shoulder spots on the back. Their ear and flight membrane is dark, but not black. The ears are long enough to extend at least 4 mm beyond the tip of the nose when pressed forward. The tragus is long, upward pointing, and tapered at the end, in contrast with the short, blunt ended tragus (a fleshy projection that covers the ear canal) of the little brown bat. The outside edge of the tail membrane has a fringe of tiny hairs, visible with a hand lens. Keen's myotis averages 9 cm in length and 8 grams in weight. They have been documented to live upto 13 years."

        name: "Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus)",

        description: "Little brown bats are small, flying, nocturnal mammals. Their fur varies in color from cinnamon-buff to dark brown on their back, and buffy to pale gray on their underside. The hairs on their back have long glossy tips. Juveniles are more uniformly dark brown in color. Little brown bats typically weigh 5–9 grams and are 3–4 ½ inches in length. With a wingspan of only 8–9 inches, the little brown bat can reach speeds up to 22 miles per hour, with an average speed of 12 miles per hour. Bats have a tragus, a fleshy projection that covers the ear canal (the entrance to the ear) and aids in echolocation. Bats sleep during the day and hunt and feed during the night. When not feeding, bats can be found resting in a variety of natural and man-made structures — these resting areas are called roosts."

        name: "Silver-haired Bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans)",
        img: "images/silver-haired-bat.jpeg",
        description: "The silver-haired bat is a small, insectivorous, flying mammal. It bat receives its name from its dark, silver-tipped fur.

Their wings are black as are the ears and interfemoral membrane. The interfemoral membrane is a thin layer of skin which stretches between the bats legs. It assists the bat with flight and catching prey. The silver-haired bat has short ears (15 to 17 mm in height), which are rounded and hairless with a blunt tragus. The tragus is a fleshy projection that covers the ear canal, the entrance of the ear. The silver-haired bat is a medium sized bat ranging from 9–11.5 cm in length and 8–12 grams in weight."

        name: "Black Bear (Ursus americanus)",
        img: "images/black-bear.png",
        description: "Black bears are the smallest of the North American bear and the most abundant and widely distributed of the three species of North American bears. An estimated 100,000 black bears inhabit Alaska. Adults stand about 29 inches at the shoulders and are about 60 inches from nose to tail. Males are larger than females, and weigh about 180-200 pounds in the spring. Black bears can vary in color from jet black to white. Black is the color encountered most frequently across the state, but brown or cinnamon-colored black bears are sometimes seen in Southcentral Alaska and on the southeastern mainland. Cinnamon-colored black bears are also common in Alaska’s Interior. Some bluish-colored bears called glacier bears may be found in the Yakutat area and in other parts of Southeast Alaska. Black bears often have brown muzzles and some also have a patch of white hair on their chest."
